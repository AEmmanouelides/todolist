# TodoList

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Notes
- The app is responsive.
- Data are fetched into the app by using `Fetch` API (browser build-in tool) through a fake free api from <a href="http://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/" rel="nofollow" target='_blank'>Jsonplaceholder</a>.
- <a href="https://reactjs.org/docs/context.html" rel="nofollow" target='_blank'>React Context</a> library was used to pass Todos data through the component tree without having to pass props down manually at every level.
- `SCSS` preprocessor was used for stylesheets management.
